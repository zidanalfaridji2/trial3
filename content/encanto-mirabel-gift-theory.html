        <p>Literally anyone can do what mirabel did. But abuela&#039;s power may actually be the most important of all the madrigals&#039; abilities. Though several of the madrigals get magical powers, mirabel madrigal (stephanie beatriz) doesn&#039;t receive a supernatural ability during the night of her gift ceremony. Since mirabel has two sisters representing beauty and brawn, it makes sense that her gift is brains/smarts. Watch the trailer for the disney animation here:</p>
