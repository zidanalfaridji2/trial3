        <p>When you buy a specialty gift card, you agree to the terms and conditions of the card from the third party retailer, restaurant or theatre you choose. Can you buy cigarettes with a walmart gift card? …if you have one of these, it will clearly state on the front “this gift card cannot be used to purchase tobacco”. Whether you want to turn the gift card into cash or use the remaining funds on the card, you can do it with a few simple tricks. It doesn&#039;t actually stipulate no returns prior to purchase.</p>
