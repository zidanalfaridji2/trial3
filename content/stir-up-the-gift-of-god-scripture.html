        <p>For this reason, i remind you to stir into flame the gift of god that you have through the imposition of my hands. In the new king james version of the bible, the verse is translated, stir up the gift of god. the gift is not something we learn. We have to stir ourselves to rekindle our love for god and the brethren and serve them in humility and kindness. Isaiah 43:26 put me in remembrance: I’ve been using that gift ever since.</p>
