        <p>Though encanto makes it look like mirabel gets snubbed during her gift ceremony in casita, the character may have secretly had a gift all along.mirabel madrigal (stephanie beatriz) isn’t like the rest of her family in encanto. She shares it with abuela, and her purpose is to take over from abuela as the head of the family one day. At the end of encanto, the family creates a doorknob for mirabel to open their new house with. She’ll probably inherit abuela’s room. Encanto centers on mirabel, the only madrigal child who didn&#039;t get a magical gift.</p>
