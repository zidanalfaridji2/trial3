        <p>Personalized gifts are a great way to give someone a special gift. Bar mitzvah attendees shouldn&#039;t be afraid to stray from tradition and replace cash with other gifts. A bar mitzvah isn&#039;t a wedding and shouldn&#039;t be treated at all with the same light as a wedding. Gifts are an integral part of a bar or bat mitzvah celebration. While lacking in spiritual significance, he’s sure to receive plenty of “meaningful” and “appropriate” bar mitzvah gifts from everyone else, so why not be the cool aunt, uncle, cousin, brother, sister, or friend, and get him something fun?</p>
