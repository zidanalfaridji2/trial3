        <p>You also will need to make this via paypal, wise, cryptocurrency or a bank transfer. As part of your overall financial and estate planning, a legacy gift provides an opportunity to support an organization that is meaningful to you, and at the same time to preserve and enjoy assets you might need during your lifetime.
