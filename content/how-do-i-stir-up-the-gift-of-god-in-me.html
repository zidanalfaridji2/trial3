        <p>Stir up [rekindle] the gift of god which is in you through the laying on of my hands. It is something god gave us. We stir up the gift by believing we have a gift to give. Paul said to timothy, “wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands” (2 timothy 1:6). I emphasize on verse 6 wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands paul, writing to young timothy, saying, timothy, you have been saved.</p>
