        <p>Walmart gift cards never expire. No matter what state you are in, it’s not a good idea to use a gift card that you’ve found. They also won&#039;t reimburse you for the tax. The fastest way to get cash for a gift card is to sell your card at a gift card exchange kiosk—the yellow one. On the walmart website, you can check your purchase history, which displays the latest eligible date for a return or replacement.</p>
