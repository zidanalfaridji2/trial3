        <p>The &#039;unified&#039; lifetime gift and estate tax exemption amount (applicable to us citizens and most green card holders) has increased from $11,700,000 to $12,060,000. Partners are able to gift each other as much money as they wish during their lifetime with no tax implications, as long as both partners are permanent residents of the uk. Married couples potentially can exclude twice that amount, or $24,120,000. For tax year 2022, for family coverage, the annual deductible is not less than $4,950, up from $4,800 in 2021; Gift tax is a federal tax on money or assets you give that are worth more than the annual exclusion of $16,000 in 2022.</p>
