        <p>This trick allows you to combine and consolidate small balances left on your amex gift cards (it works for visa and mastercard too). Gift card mall is among the largest gift card sites online that allow you to buy a virtual visa gift card with paypal. Now here is where it gets a bit tricky because like me paypal wants to be paid if we use their service so i had to make sure i calculated how much i would be assessed in fee’s when sending the payment (use this nifty calculator here). I&#039;m not even sure if that step is necessary anymore since you can reload your amazon gift balance directly with your prepaid cards, and it all becomes credit on your amazon account that usually will automatically be. During my search on the web, i didn’t find a resource describing a solution.</p>
