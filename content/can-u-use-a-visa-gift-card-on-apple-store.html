        <p>Do not make the mistake of putting the gift card number in the gift card field. Visa preloaded cards are also an exception, as they can be used anywhere in place of a debit or credit card or cash. Buy apple gift card use it to shop the app store, apple tv, apple music, itunes, apple arcade, the apple store app, apple.com, and the apple store. A small comparison between a visa gift card against any other gift card would be that while other gift cards can only be used at specific locations, visa can be used a maximum amount of times in various scenarios. I recently got a visa gift card in the mail.</p>
