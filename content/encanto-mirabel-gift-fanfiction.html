        <p>The casita, destined to be destroyed all because of mirabel and her lack of a gift. Mirabel was back to the night of her gift ceremony. Well, i don’t know if this quite ticks all your boxes, but i started a story yesterday where mirabel does get a gift. The madrigal family looks on in anticipation for mirabel’s gift. But luckily her tio bruno is there to keep her company.</p>

        <p>Encanto x reader mirabel madrigal the madrigals. When he finally did notice her. These tags will make sense soon; What if mirabel didn&#039;t come back by crazyinparticular. During encanto, we see that each member of the madrigal family gets their gift by turning the knob of a magic door that leads to a room made just for them.</p>

        <p>Mirabel madrigal doesn&#039;t get a gift in encanto, and a small detail may finally explain why.in disney&#039;s encanto, mirabel madrigal (stephanie beatriz) is the only child in the family madrigal that doesn&#039;t get a magical gift. She was simply another girl living in the town, helping her parents out at their library, and blending into the background. The madrigal family looks on in anticipation for mirabel’s gift. The suspense was driving them crazy. After watching encanto, i couldn&#039;t help but think of this possible idea, since i&#039;m sure someone&#039;ll be interested in ether adopting or making their own version.</p>
