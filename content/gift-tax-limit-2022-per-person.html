        <p>Once you are married, the sum doubles. The amount you can gift to any one person without filing a gift tax form is increasing to $16,000 in 2022, the first increase. So even if you do give outrageously, you wouldn’t have to file a gift tax return unless you went over those limits. However, the federal gift tax exemption allows you to gift away up to $15,000 to as many people as you want every year. So you can give as many people as you want.</p>
