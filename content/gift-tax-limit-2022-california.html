        <p>The annual gift tax exclusion was indexed for inflation as part of the tax relief act of 1997, so the amount can increase from year to year to keep pace with the economy, but only in increments of $1,000. Any gift above the exclusion is subject to taxes, but there are. The federal estate tax exclusion is also climbing to more than $12 million per individual. That tax rate can climb to as high as 40%. Federal estate, gift, and gst tax.</p>

        <p>There are a few exceptions, such as the federal estate tax. 1 that means if you had the money, you could whip out your checkbook and write $16,000 checks to your mom, your brother, your sister, your new best friends (you’ll have lots of “friends” if you start giving away free money), and you wouldn’t have to pay a gift tax. Just make sure to keep your ear to the ground because change could be on the horizon. This increase means that a married couple can shield. Generally speaking, inheritance is not subject to tax in california.</p>
