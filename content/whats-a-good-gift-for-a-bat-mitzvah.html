        <p>Flickr user n0nick via wikipedia. This jewish tradition marks the beginning of the bar or bat mitzvah’s adult life, and money and practical gifts are ways to start them off on the right foot. A general rule for bar or bat mitzvah gift giving is to take the amount you would normally spend on a birthday present and give 1.5 times that amount, in a multiple of 18. And with this technologically advanced chair as a bar/bat mitzvah gift, you’ll get to show how cool and “hip” you are! Therefore, giving a cash bat mitzvah gift of $18, $36, $54, $72 or another monetary amount based upon this $18 dollar increment system literally symbolizes the gift of “life” to the recipient.</p>
