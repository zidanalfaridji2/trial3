In jewish tradition, the number 18 symbolizes “chai,” hebrew for “life.” giving an amount that’s a multiple of 18 is a way of symbolically gifting a long and happy life to the young person of honor. A gift in the order of something like triple &#039;chai&#039; or $54 would be a neat idea to give from teenager to teenager at the bar mitzvah. Guests often gift money in increments of $18, a symbol of “chai,” in jewish tradition, which means “life.” it is also completely acceptable to round to normal.</p>
