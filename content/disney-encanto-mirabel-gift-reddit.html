        <p>Mirabel gift(?) [spoiler warning : So i got this theory. A bad idea about mirabels&#039; gift. I thi j she does have a gift, and it is that when she asks about what&#039;s bothering someone, or why we don&#039;t talk about bruno, or something similar they tell her. What hurts her is the way her grandmother reacted to her not getting her gift and pushing her aside.</p>
