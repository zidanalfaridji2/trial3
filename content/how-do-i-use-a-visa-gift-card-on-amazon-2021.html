        <p>One way to convert visa gift cards to cash is to use them like cash. One thing to note here is that an amazon gift card is not a debit card. Amazon purchases with amex gift cards. The new offer is $150 (for both amazon and whole foods market versions). Use your prepaid visa card as payment.</p>
