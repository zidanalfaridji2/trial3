        <p>Throughout the movie, it&#039;s unclear whether mirabel has a power that is yet to be unlocked or not. Mirabel becomes the subject of family disappointment when she doesn&#039;t get a unique gift. Why mirabel didn&#039;t get a gift [spoilers] her grandma didn&#039;t have a gift either, so this makes total sense. This movie is still amazing though you can&#039;t lie about that. He asks mirabel what would happen if he didn&#039;t get a gift or if something didn&#039;t work.</p>
