        <p>If you’ve never heard of this concept, it may feel a bit awkward. Posted by 2 years ago. A fragrance like this is great for layering, but it can also be worn on it&#039;s own. Tried &#039;juliette has a gun not a perfume&#039; at the department store today. While i&#039;ve tried sampling more expensive perfumes i could never really find one that felt worth the cost.</p>
