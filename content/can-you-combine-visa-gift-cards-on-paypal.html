Although you cannot combine the balances on your various visa gift cards onto one gift card, you can pay with more than one funding source. In addition, you cannot split a single payment between 2 paypal accounts.</p>

        <p>The limit is $75 on each card, even if you were to put refunds. Once linked, you can then checkout through paypal and select your paypal balance as your payment method. One way to convert visa gift cards to cash is to use them like cash. I recommend using the card as the regular way. For instance, if you know your visa gift card balance is below $10.00, you may have a hard time using that balance to complete a purchase entirely on that card.</p>
