        <p>There are many special things about the extended ‘madrigal’ family, but central to the story is the magical gift bestowed on the children and grandchildren of the matriarch, only referred to as. However, if the theory is true, alma passively pushing for mirabel&#039;s parents to have another child could be her giving herself a chance at redemption. Why mirabel didn&#039;t get a gift [spoilers] her grandma didn&#039;t have a gift either, so this makes total sense. In encanto &#039;s opening song, mirabel sings to the town&#039;s children and describes all of the different magical powers her family has. What are the powers of mirabel?</p>

The candle also appears to be fizzling out, despite alma telling mirabel that it. Bit.ly/subscribebtt encanto movie review with spoilers today!</p>
