        <p>Amex clearly states in their terms and conditions that the saks statement credit is not valid on saks fifth avenue gift cards. Can i buy a gift card with my $50 amex platinum saks fifth avenue credit? The amex platinum comes with a $550 annual fee ( see rates and fees) — but it also comes with $1,100+ in savings each year. Make sure you use the saks fifth avenue credits! So it is pretty easy to utilize the $50 credit two times a year in my case.</p>
