        <p>Add a visa gift card to your venmo account. Sign up to create an account at moneygram. Go to the “you” tab by selecting the single person icon ; If you have a gift card, maybe multiple cards with small amounts in them, you can use the balance as a whole using paypal. Using venmo can often be better than using paypal, especially if you want to transfer the money to your bank account to use as cash.</p>
