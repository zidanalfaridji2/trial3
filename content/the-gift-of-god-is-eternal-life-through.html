        <p>9 not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 5:12 wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; He who has the son has the life; Jesus, the giver of eternal life was prophesied to come by god through the mouth of many prophets in the old testament. For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt. You probably heard that the gift of god is eternal life or that if you believe in jesus, you have eternal life a thousand times in church.</p>
	<h3>But The Gift Of God Is Eternal Life Through Jesus Christ Our Lord.” Romans 6:23 Introduction:</h3>
        			<p> <strong>The gift of god is eternal life through</strong>.  The gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus. A gift is the opposite of a wage. Our beloved brother paul made the cross of christ his preaching emphasis (i cor Instead, you say, “god, i believe. It is a reward that we absolutely deserve. </p>
					<p> Romans 6:23 for the wages of sin is death; We get to heaven only through jesus’ blood and merit, not our own! Jesus was born in the city of bethlehem as prophesied, he lived, died and was resurrected on the third day. And the testimony is this, that god has given us eternal life, and this life is in his son. Sin has its own reward, but eternal life is a gift! </p>
					<p> For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt. And this is not your own doing; 9 not of works, lest any man should boast. This gift is in contrast to the “death” that is the natural result of sin. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to god, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. </p>
					<p> Eternal life is a gift paid for by the son of god, jesus christ, which we must receive through faith in his finished work on the cross. But through faith in jesus christ, we received the gift of god, which is the salvation of souls unto eternal life: Titus 1:2 in hope of eternal life, which god, who never lies, promised before the ages began. For the wages of sin is death; Life eternal is a gift from god that was given to the world over two thousand years ago, in the person of “jesus christ, who is the incarnate god” (jn. </p>
					<p> Jn 3:36 faith in jesus christ, god’s son, is the only way to gain eternal life. He punished jesus so thoroughly that. But there is also a “new way of life” in romans 6:4 where we are in romans 6:11 “alive to god in jesus. “the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord.” the first christmas was the gift of christ coming into the world to purchase for us eternal life by dying in our place and rising again. It will never be repeated. </p>
					<p> He who has the son has the life; Jesus, the giver of eternal life was prophesied to come by god through the mouth of many prophets in the old testament. However, god is eternal which means he has no beginning and no end, and thus for him, there is no past or future since everything is in the present. You have to empty your hands of any attempt to save yourself or to earn god’s forgiveness by joining the church or getting baptized or trying to be better than other people. “ and this is the w ay to have eternal life—to know you, the only true god, and jesus christ, the one you sent to earth.”. </p>
					<p> We have not earned, or do not earn eternal life, it is a free and precious gift through jesus christ our lord and saviour. Verse 22 says, but now having been freed from sin and enslaved to god, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life. you can see the contrast between sin as one slave master and god as another slave master. He gives it “through jesus christ”. Eternal life is a gift “for the wages of sin is death; God is using these words to reach out to you right now to offer you the free gift of eternal life. </p>
					<p> For through the law comes the knowledge of sin. Romans 5:12 wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of god and the gift by the grace of the one. But the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord.” romans 6:23 introduction: God created us to live forever. </p>
					<p> Sin came down and death cut off the gift of eternal life. But the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord. The bible also says, “for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord.” a gift is something that we need to accept freely, without trying to pay for it or earn it in any way. But the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord…”. It is the gift of god: </p>
					<p> It is the gift of god, 9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast. But this is not mandatory to have the gift of eternal life. The bible tells us that we have all sinned and come short of the glory. To receive god’s gift of salvation, you have to admit that you need god’s gift. The very moment we accept jesus christ as our lord and savior we are given the gift of eternal life! </p>
					<p> And so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: They are two competing slave masters. The gift of eternal life comes to those who believe in jesus christ, who is himself “the resurrection and the life” (john 11:25). All god asks is that we believe on the name of jesus, that he is the christ, the son of god who came into the world to save men from their sins (john 20:31). And that not of yourselves: </p>
					<p> To live in the eternal now is. Thus, eternal life is a free gift that does not require any compensation, obligation or prerequisites to receive it. Even more striking is the fact that he gives it to people who earned death! He who does not have the son of god does not have the life. Thanking god for the gift of eternal life. </p>
					<p> The incarnation is past, once for all. For the wages of sin is death; 8 for by grace you have been saved through faith. Many people have quoted this phrase in romans 6:23 “the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord” and it does give us, those who have accepted jesus christ, a future hope. We earn death because of our sinful nature. </p>
					<p> You probably heard that the gift of god is eternal life or that if you believe in jesus, you have eternal life a thousand times in church. Posted on friday, january 21, 2022. “for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. When the bible speaks of eternal life, it refers to a gift of god that comes only “through jesus christ our lord” (romans 6:23). And this christmas — as every christmas — is a time when god is still giving. </p>
					<p> [romans 6:23 kjv] “ for the wages of sin is death; Genesis 2:17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: Eternal life is god’s gift through jesus. But the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord. All you do to receive it is to believe, repent, and continue in this faith! </p>
					<p> John, 20:31, “but these are written, that ye might believe that jesus is the christ, the son of god; And that believing ye might have life through his name.” They act like “karens” (my apologies to the wonderful women i know named karen) and object to jesus about his disciples—that they ate without. God does remind us that he paid a great price and we ought to live for him; But the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord”. </p>
					<p> This is the way we should live like there is no past or future. Eternal life is a free gift from god through jesus christ. What is even more startling, however, is the next phrase: 8 for by grace are ye saved through faith; “for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” john 3:16 niv “for the wages of sin is. </p>
					<p> Here is what scripture has to say about eternal life…. Because by the works of the law no flesh will be justified in his sight; Instead of punishing us for our sins, he punished jesus in our place. That is what paul has been developing with the slavery image all through this chapter. Think about it this way. </p>
					<p> But in contrast, a gift is given as a result of the generosity of the giver. “but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord.” god gives eternal life as a gift! If your best friend knew that you really wanted a new rolex watch and they saved and saved so that they could buy the watch for your birthday. </p>
