        <p>Reddit user thegreendorito123 proposed, in a post to the fan theories subreddit, that mirabel is not, in fact, giftless, but is magically linked to. Log in or sign up to leave a comment. By the end of the movie, mirabel and the rest of the madrigals are finally able to understand each other. Well um, mirabel does have a gift technically. Mostly because of the end when she opened the door the whole house became magical again soooooooo.</p>
