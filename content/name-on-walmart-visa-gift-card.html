Use your walmart visa gift card everywhere visa debit cards are accepted in the fifty (50) states of the united states and the district of columbia, excluding puerto rico and the other united states territories. I quickly ripped the card from its packaging and went to the dedicated website to “register” my card so that i could use it to make an online purchase. You cannot, but you can do the opposite, which would be to purchase a walmart gift card with a prepaid visa, as it’s treated like any other credit card. Can i use my walmart gift card on paypal?</p>
