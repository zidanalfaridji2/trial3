        			<p> <strong>Faith is a gift from god ephesians</strong>.  For theodoret, the antecedent of καὶ τοῦτο in ephesians 2:9 is what he describes as μόνην τὴν πίστιν. There are many other passages to which we could go. I can confirm kuyper’s assertion. This theory is the offspring of calvinism. It is the gift of god: </p>
					<p> The bible emphasizes that faith is a gift because god deserves all the glory for our salvation. A gift is not earned by some good deed or kind word, and it is not given because the giver expects a gift in return—under any of those conditions, a gift would not be a gift. It says, “for by grace you have been saved. Admittedly, from a cursory reading of ephesians 2:8, it may appear that the demonstrative pronoun this has faith as its grammatical antecedent. John piper is founder and teacher of desiringgod.org and chancellor of bethlehem college &amp; seminary. </p>
					<p> The cause or guilt of this unbelief as well as of all other sins, is no wise in god, but in man himself; So please understand that faith that has its source in us falls short of the lord&#039;s commandment. Faith is presented as a gift from god in 2 peter 1:1, philippians 1:29, and acts 3:16. Whereas faith in jesus christ, and salvation through him is the free gift of god, as it is written: And unto you it is given in the behalf of christ, not only to believe on him, etc. </p>
					<p> God requires perfect faith and we can&#039;t do muster such a faith as that. Ephesians 2:8 is a significant passage in this debate. For 33 years, he served as pastor of bethlehem baptist church, minneapolis, minnesota. The ‘gift of god’ on the ‘majority’ understanding is the concept ‘salvation by grace through faith’. “for by grace you have been saved through faith, and faith is not of yourselves, faith is the gift of god.”. </p>
					<p> They read ephesians 2:8 this way: The closest antecedent is not. This parallelism serves as a commentary to v 8a (“for by grace you have. Based upon a misunderstanding of ephesians 2:8, some argue that faith is a gift from god, and that it is not, therefore, a condition of salvation. [and] that not of yourselves: </p>
					<p> The antecedent to “gift” is actually “faith.”. The adjective μόνην (alone) is significant, because it qualifies the faith. There are numerous problems with this approach to ephesians 2:8, the greatest being that it reveals a complete disregard for the greek text. By grace ye are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of god, ephesians 2:8. This view has, of the ancient exegetes, at least implicitly, marius victorinus as an adherent, and theophylact explicitly suggests it as an alternative to his first option, which follows the main stream of the eastern exegesis, that ‘faith’ is the denominated gift. </p>
					<p> Others likewise hold that salvation is a free gift but see faith as being personal. For centuries, various bible commentators have differed on the precise reference of the pronoun “that” in ephesians 2:8. This week&#039;s question explores this issue. Those who believe that faith is a gift (i.e., miraculous imposition) from god, often point out that in this verse “faith” is the nearest antecedent of “this. In other words, believing is the role of the individual in securing the gift of salvation. </p>
					<p> Understood accordingly, ephesians 2:8 could well be translated: Nearly all the church fathers […] judged that the words “it is the gift of god” refer to faith […] this was the exegesis […] of those that spoke the greek language and were familiar with the peculiar greek construction. So the ground for the proposition that divine grace is a synergos of faith is that faith is said by the apostle to be the gift of god. For if faith is a gift from god, it comes from god at the beginning of salvation. Only a minority of ancient commentators associate ‘this’ exclusively with salvation, eight ancient exegetes specifically. </p>

Faith comes from god in the form of a gift ( ephesians 2:8 ). Frantic at missing the evangelist, he decided to ask one of the workers what he could do to be saved. </p>
					<p> But in this passage, the image of seed requires that the beginning and initiation of salvation lies with human free will. The story is told of a man who came eagerly but very late to a revival meeting and found the workmen tearing down the tent in which the meetings had been held. Is faith “the gift of god,” or is this gift salvation by grace through faith? Not as a result of works, lest anyone should boast.”. It is the gift of god, not of works, lest anyone should boast.for we are his workmanship, created in christ jesus for good works, which god prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. </p>
					<p> Faith that is our doing doesn&#039;t get the job done. Some believe that salvation is a gift from god and even the faith a person exercises in order to be saved comes from god. It is the gift of god, not of works, lest anyone should boast. Moreover, there is a parallelism between not of yourselves in v 8b and not of works in v 9. “for by grace you have been saved through faith, that is to say, not of yourselves, it is the gift of god.”. </p>
